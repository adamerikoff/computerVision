**Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**

Reinforcement learning enables agents to learn through trial and error in an environment, seeking to maximize long-term rewards for their actions. Here are some common algorithms you can consider implementing:

* **Value-Based Methods:**
    * Q-Learning
    * SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
* **Policy-Based Methods:**
    * Policy Gradients
    * Actor-Critic Methods
* **Model-Based Methods:**
    * Model Predictive Control (MPC)
    * Dyna-Q
