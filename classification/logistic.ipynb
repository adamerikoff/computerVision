    "## 1. Information\n",
    "Logistic regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems. Nowadays, it’s commonly used only for constructing a baseline model. Still, it’s an excellent first algorithm to build because it’s highly interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, logistic regression is similar to linear regression. We’re still dealing with a line equation for making predictions. This time, the results are passed through a Sigmoid activation function to convert real values to probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability tells you the chance of the instance belonging to a positive class (e.g., this customer has a 0.85 churn probability). These probabilities are then turned to actual classes based on a threshold value. If the probability is greater than the threshold, we assign the positive class and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold value can (and should) be altered depending on the problem and the type of metric you’re optimizing for.\n",
