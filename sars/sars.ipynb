    "The __SARSA__ *(State-Action-Reward-State-Action)* is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm used to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in the context of sequential decision-making. SARSA is a member of the family of temporal difference (TD) learning methods and is particularly useful for training agents in environments with discrete states and actions."

    "- **State (S):** In a reinforcement learning problem, the environment is divided into states (or observations), which represent the situations or configurations that the agent can encounter.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Action (A):** At each state, the agent can take one of several possible actions. Actions represent the choices made by the agent to interact with the environment.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Reward (R):** After taking an action in a specific state, the agent receives a reward from the environment. Rewards provide feedback to the agent about the desirability of its actions.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Policy (π):** The policy defines the agent's strategy or behavior, specifying which action to take in each state. SARSA is an on-policy algorithm, meaning it learns and updates the policy it uses to interact with the environment.<br><br>"

    "- **Q-Values (Action-Value Function):** SARSA aims to estimate the Q-values, denoted as Q(s, a), which represent the expected cumulative reward that can be obtained by starting in state $s$, taking action $a$, and following a specific policy $\\pi$ thereafter. The goal is to find the optimal Q-values that maximize the expected return.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Q-Table:** SARSA maintains a Q-table (or Q-function), which is a data structure that stores Q-values for each state-action pair. Initially, these values are typically initialized randomly.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** SARSA balances exploration (trying different actions to discover the environment) and exploitation (choosing actions that are believed to be the best based on current Q-value estimates). This balance is controlled by an exploration strategy, often based on $\\varepsilon$-greedy exploration, where with probability $\\varepsilon$, the agent chooses a random action, and with probability $1-\\varepsilon$, it chooses the action with the highest estimated Q-value.<br><br>"
